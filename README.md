In the project, I undertake the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project will culminate with a presentation of a data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization.

## Data Wrangling and Visualisation
<p align="justify">
The next part include some data wrangling to identify and remove duplicate values, identify and impute missing values in the dataset and finally normalize data in a dataset. We will also focus on the visualization of data presented in the form of a RDBMS using SQL queries to extract the data.
